title: "My Laptop is sooo Hot!!"

I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my old Thinkpad T410i. But after the machine booted, it is sooo hot that can be used for frying eggs. I searched much online. Some said that it is because Ubuntu 14.04 does not handle dual graphic units well. Though my old T410i does not show two graphic units, I tried installing NVIDIA Driver and it seems help a little to cool down the machine. The steps are as follow:

1. Add Nouveau to blacklist. Add `blacklist nouveau` to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
2. Install Nvidia Driver and Prime
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nvidia-340 nvidia-prime
    ```

3. Install Nvidia Prime indicator
    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install prime-indicator
    ```
Then reboot the machine.
