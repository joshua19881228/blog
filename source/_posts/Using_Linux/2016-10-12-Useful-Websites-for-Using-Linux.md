Recently I hang much with Ubuntu because I am trying some interesting computer vision projects which are developed in Linux environment. In addition Steam supports to play Sid Meier's Civilization V using its SteamOS platform, which means that I do not have to log into Windows to play my favourite computer game. In the purpose of using Ubuntu well, I have learn much from some websites that I have listed following.

1. [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php)

    Designed for the new command line user, this 540-page volume covers the same material as LinuxCommand.org but in much greater detail. In addition to the basics of command line use and shell scripting, The Linux Command Line includes chapters on many common programs used on the command line, as well as more advanced topics.

7. [Mastering Bash and Terminal](https://www.blockloop.io/mastering-bash-and-terminal)

    >If there is one tool that every developer uses regardless of language, platform, or framework it's the terminal. If we are not compiling code, executing git commands, or scp-ing ssl certificates to some remote server, we are finding a new version of cowsay to entertain ourselves while we wait on one of the former. As much as we use the terminal it is important that we are efficient with it. Here are some ways I make my time in the terminal efficient and effective.
