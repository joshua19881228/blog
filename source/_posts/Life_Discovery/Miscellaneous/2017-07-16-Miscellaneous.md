This weekend was so hot that everyone seems to be bad tempered and have difficulty to breathe. However, I helped myself to feel the beauty of life by cooking myself food and going out to watch a movie. Recently, I've been always hiding in a room with air-conditioning, feeling bored to almost anything. Perhaps, when it is hot, it is time to sweat. Sweating made me loose much pressure and feel re-freshed. The cold udon noodles and bolognese calmed me down and gave me energy.
