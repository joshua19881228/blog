I've been a big fun of sailing boats since I was a little child. I do not know what in my childhood that made sailing boats so attractive to me. Maybe it is my fantasies of the romance of sailors, the fabulous view of the wild ocean, or the beauty of the boats themselves. 

One of my favourite computer games is [Uncharted Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_Waters), also called Daikoukai Jidai, which sets its story at the time between the 15th century and the 17th century when European explorers sailed the seas to open new alternative ways to Asia when the Ottoman Empire blocked the land routes. This is the first video game that I played related to sailing boats. Then I had great fun playing [Corsairs: Conquest at Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsairs:_Conquest_at_Sea) and [Sid Meier's Pirates!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Pirates!_(2004_video_game)). Even when I was playing [Age of Empires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires) and [Sid Meier's Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)), I'd like to build naval units to conquer my enemies if possible.

Movies having the element of sailing entertain me much as well. [Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_and_Commander:_The_Far_Side_of_the_World) is the best one. It tells a story about how Captain Jack Aubrey of British HMS Surprise led his crew to defeat a fierce enemy, French privateer Acheron during the Napoleonic Wars. Besides their optimism during the war that inspires me much, the music in the movie also opened a door for me to the classic music. Another must mentioned film series is [Pirates of the Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(film_series)). This film series combines adventure and comedy, which made me laugh out loud.

Though I love sailing boats so, I did not gain much knowledge about them and their time much. Recently I found a very fruitful [Chinese blog](http://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404036325048201909) in this topic. It's time for me to start reading!
