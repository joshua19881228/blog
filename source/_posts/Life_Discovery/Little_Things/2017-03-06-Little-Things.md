We can see the vague image of Orion right below the Moon and Alhena top left, Aldebaran top right, Sirius left bottom. I've not been looking at the stars for a long time! I can not even remember when was the last time I do that.

Orion was the first constellation that I learnt by reading a book telling stories and myths about the stars for kids. I was attracted by Orion because of the myth that how he became one of the constellations. 

> One myth recounts Gaia's rage at Orion, who dared to say that he would kill every animal on the planet. The angry goddess tried to dispatch Orion with a scorpion. This is given as the reason that the constellations of Scorpius and Orion are never in the sky at the same time. However, Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer, revived Orion with an antidote. This is said to be the reason that the constellation of Ophiuchus stands midway between the Scorpion and the Hunter in the sky.

Another interesting thing is that the pyramids in Giza reflect the belt of Orion. I shared these stories with my classmates in senior school when I was giving a speech to the whole class. I think another reason that I like Orion is that I was born in winter and Orion has the brightest stars in winter.
