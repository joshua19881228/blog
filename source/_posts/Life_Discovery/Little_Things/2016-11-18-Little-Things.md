I've just tried a very interesting and fun website called [*Quick, Draw!*](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/#), which is developed by Google Creative Lab and Data Arts Team. This is a game built with machine learning. The user draws, and a neural network tries to guess what the user is drawing. It is really fun.
