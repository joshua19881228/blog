### CONTRIBUTIONS ###

1. A framework called Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) is develpped for object detection, which consists of *shared*, *fully convolutional* architectures.
2. A set of *position-sensitive* score maps are introduced to enalbe FCN representing translation variance.
3. A unique ROI pooling method is proposed to shepherd information from metioned score maps.

### METHOD ###

1. The image is processed by a FCN manner network.
2. At the end of FCN, a RPN (Region Proposal Network) is used to generate ROIs.
3. On the other hand, a score map of $k^{2}(C+1)$ channels is generated using a bank of specialized convolutional layers.
4. For each ROI, a selective ROI pooling is utilized to generate a $C+1$ channel score map.
5. The scores in the score map are averaged to vote for category.
6. Another $ 4k^2 $ dim convolutional layer is learned for bounding box regression.

**Training Details**

1. R-FCN is trained end-to-end with pre-computed region proposals. Both category and position are learnt with the loss function $L(s,t_{x,y,w,h})=L_{cls}(s_{c})+\lambda[c>0]L_{reg}(t)$
2. For each image, N proposals are generated and B out of N proposals are selected to train weights according to the highest losses. B is set to 128 in this work.
3. 4-step alternating training is utilized to realizing feature sharing between R-FCN and RPN.

### ADVANTAGES ###

1. It is fast (170ms/image, 2.5-20x faster than Faster R-CNN).
2. End-to-end training is easier to process.
3. All learnable layers are convolutional and shared on the entire image, yet encode spatial information required for object detection.

### DISADVANTAGES ###

1. Compared with Single Shot methods, more computation resource is needed.
