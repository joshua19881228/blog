My name is Zhixuan LI, and if you like you can call me Joshua which sounds similar to my Chinese name in some way. I am an engineer familiar with computer vision and related applications.

Well...I have drawn a mind map for the purpose of self introduction. You can refer to it in the following image and I hope it is helpful. In addition, you can find the code of this website [here](https://github.com/joshua19881228/joshua19881228.github.io) and find me at [github](https://github.com/joshua19881228). My email is zhixuan.1988.li [AT] gmail [DOT] com. At last thank you for your visiting my website.
